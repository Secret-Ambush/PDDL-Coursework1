## Lunar Exploration Planning in PDDL: Domain, Missions, and Design Rationale

### Abstract
This report documents the design and implementation of a PDDL domain and three planning problems modeling a simplified lunar exploration scenario. We formalize rover and lander operations for mobility, data acquisition, communication, and sample handling. We first present the baseline domain used in Part A&B and then the extended domain in Part C that introduces human operators (astronauts) and rooms that gate certain actions. For each mission, we specify the initial state, goals, salient constraints, and how the domain supports the required plans. We conclude with modeling choices, assumptions, and potential extensions.
